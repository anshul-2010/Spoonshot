Assignment for Internship
Problem 1:
  Here, I have attached the .pynb file for the Q1. Also, I have added the texts Article and List_Ingredients, which need to be uploaded to the session storage before running the .pynb file. The outputs generated from running the .pynb file have been attached in the github repo.
  In the Output2_Method2, u will notice that some have some number written after it. The number is just to denote the time that same ingredient has appeared in the query matching and nothing else.
  
 Problem 2:
 Here I have written the code for optimum solution as per me. The other solutions, which I had thought of before arriving at this solution, I have mentioned them in the Final submission pdf.
 
 Problem 3:
  I have attached a pdf file to the github repo where the third question has been answered.
